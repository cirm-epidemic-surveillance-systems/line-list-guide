title: Designing Line Lists for Epidemiological Analysis: A Practical Guide
---

Epidemiological line lists are a foundational tool for outbreak analytics, capturing individual-level data on cases and enabling the estimation of key quantities such as transmission rates, severity ratios, and delay distributions.
They are often among the earliest and most detailed sources of information available during an emerging outbreak, forming the basis for real-time assessment and response.

However, line lists are frequently developed with priorities that do not align with analytical needs.
Fields may be inconsistently defined, data entry practices vary widely, and metadata—such as when a field was last updated or the source of a value—is often sparse or absent.
These limitations can constrain the ability to carry out robust, timely analyses or to reconstruct how data evolved over time.

Improving the structure and documentation of line lists—without overburdening data collectors—may therefore yield clear benefit.
By offering clear, analysis-oriented guidance on which fields to prioritise, how to define and manage them, and how to capture updates systematically, we aim to support the creation of line lists that are not only operationally useful but also analytically powerful. 
This guide focuses on practical recommendations to maximise the value of line lists for modelling and inference, particularly in fast-moving or resource-constrained settings.


# Types of analysis and the columns that they commonly use

| Type of Analysis                               | Key Information Required                                                       |
|----------------------------------------------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Severity**<br>(e.g., CFR, hospitalisation ratio) | Outcome data (hospitalisation, death), dates of symptom onset, admission, outcome |
| **Nowcasting**<br>(delay-adjusted estimates)       | Outcome date (symptom onset, admission, death), date of report/entry, timestamps for record updates |
| **Transmissibility (R_t)**                      | Date of symptom onset (or closest proxy to exposure), dates of reporting/testing |
| **Serial Interval**                            | Dates of symptom onset for infector–infectee pairs                              |
| **Incubation Period**                          | Date of exposure, date of symptom onset                                         |
| **Health System Delays**<br>(onset-to-admission, onset-to-death, length-of-stay) | Dates of symptom onset, admission, discharge/death                              |

Additional covariates (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities) are often critical for severity analysis and other detailed studies but are not included here to maintain clarity on core fields.

# Example: key issues with symptom onset

Date of symptom onset features in all analysis types outlined above. It is central to epidemiological analyses primarily because:

1. It is often the observable infection-related event closest to the frequently unobserved date of exposure/infection.
2. It directly relates to clinical severity and healthcare impact.

Although many recording challenges apply broadly to various epidemiological dates, we specifically highlight symptom onset due to its analytical importance and recording complexity.

| Issue                              | Description                                                                                          | Potential Remedy                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Imputation and Default Values** | Symptom onset may be auto-filled (e.g., date of report), creating misleading delay distributions.   | Avoid silent imputation; explicitly flag imputed values and document imputation rules.               |
| **Missingness**                   | Missing data may be ambiguous (e.g., not asked, asymptomatic, or forgotten).                         | Use structured missing codes; include a separate field indicating reason/status of symptom onset.    |
| **Recall Bias**                   | Onset is more accurately recalled when recent, skewing the data toward shorter delays.               | Record date of assessment.           |
| **Uncertainty**                   | Respondents may not recall precise dates.                                                            | Allow for date ranges or uncertainty flags.                                    |
| **Resolution and Rounding**       | Onset dates may be rounded (e.g., “a week ago”), causing artificial heaping at 7/14-day intervals.   | Capture qualitative answers separately; allow for date reanges or uncertainty flags.                |
| **Reporting Scheme Changes**      | Inclusion criteria may shift (e.g., only hospitalised cases recorded), affecting consistency.        | Maintain a clear data dictionary and timeline of reporting criteria and changes.                     |
| **Inconsistent Symptom Definitions** | Definitions of onset may vary (e.g., first respiratory vs. rash symptom).                          | Standardise symptom criteria where possible; document differences across datasets.                   |
| **Vagueness of 'Symptom Onset'**  | Multiple symptoms may begin at different times, affecting what is recorded as “onset.”              | Specify which symptoms qualify as onset; consider multiple onset fields for distinct symptom types.  |
