# Types of analysis and the columns that they commonly use

| Type of Analysis                               | Key Information Required                                                       |
|----------------------------------------------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Severity**<br>(e.g., CFR, hospitalisation ratio) | Outcome data (hospitalisation, death), dates of symptom onset, admission, outcome |
| **Nowcasting**<br>(delay-adjusted estimates)       | Outcome date (symptom onset, admission, death), date of report/entry, timestamps for record updates |
| **Transmissibility (R_t)**                      | Date of symptom onset (or closest proxy to exposure), dates of reporting/testing |
| **Serial Interval**                            | Dates of symptom onset for infector–infectee pairs                              |
| **Incubation Period**                          | Date of exposure, date of symptom onset                                         |
| **Health System Delays**<br>(onset-to-admission, onset-to-death, length-of-stay) | Dates of symptom onset, admission, discharge/death                              |

Additional covariates (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities) are often critical for severity analysis and other detailed studies but are not included here to maintain clarity on core fields.

# Example: key issues with symptom onset

Date of symptom onset features in all analysis types outlined above. It is central to epidemiological analyses primarily because:

1. It is often the observable infection-related event closest to the frequently unobserved date of exposure/infection.
2. It directly relates to clinical severity and healthcare impact.

Although many recording challenges apply broadly to various epidemiological dates, we specifically highlight symptom onset due to its analytical importance and recording complexity.

| Issue                              | Description                                                                                          | Potential Remedy                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Imputation and Default Values** | Symptom onset may be auto-filled (e.g., date of report), creating misleading delay distributions.   | Avoid silent imputation; explicitly flag imputed values and document imputation rules.               |
| **Missingness**                   | Missing data may be ambiguous (e.g., not asked, asymptomatic, or forgotten).                         | Use structured missing codes; include a separate field indicating reason/status of symptom onset.    |
| **Recall Bias**                   | Onset is more accurately recalled when recent, skewing the data toward shorter delays.               | Record date of assessment.           |
| **Uncertainty**                   | Respondents may not recall precise dates.                                                            | Allow for date ranges or uncertainty flags in the data structure.                                    |
| **Resolution and Rounding**       | Onset dates may be rounded (e.g., “a week ago”), causing artificial heaping at 7/14-day intervals.   | Capture qualitative answers separately; flag or adjust for common rounding artefacts.                |
| **Reporting Scheme Changes**      | Inclusion criteria may shift (e.g., only hospitalised cases recorded), affecting consistency.        | Maintain a clear data dictionary and timeline of reporting criteria and changes.                     |
| **Inconsistent Symptom Definitions** | Definitions of onset may vary (e.g., first respiratory vs. rash symptom).                          | Standardise symptom criteria where possible; document differences across datasets.                   |
| **Vagueness of 'Symptom Onset'**  | Multiple symptoms may begin at different times, affecting what is recorded as “onset.”              | Specify which symptoms qualify as onset; consider multiple onset fields for distinct symptom types.  |
