### Recap: Types of analysis and the columns that they commonly use

| Type of Analysis | Key Information Required |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Severity**<br>(e.g., CFR, hospitalisation ratio) | Outcome data (hospitalisation, death), dates of symptom onset, admission, outcome |
| **Nowcasting**<br>(delay-adjusted estimates) | Outcome date (symptom onset, admission, death), date of report/entry, timestamps for record updates |
| **Transmissibility (**$R_t$) | Date of symptom onset (or closest proxy to exposure), dates of reporting/testing |
| **Serial Interval** | Dates of symptom onset for infector–infectee pairs |
| **Incubation Period** | Date of exposure, date of symptom onset |
| **Health System Delays**<br>(onset-to-admission, onset-to-death, length-of-stay) | Dates of symptom onset, admission, discharge/death |

# Example: key issues with symptom onset

### 

| Issue | Description | Impact / Bias |
|----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Imputation and Default Values** | Symptom onset may be auto-filled (e.g., set equal to date of report) without explicit flags. | Artificially shortens delays; obscures true symptom timing; distorts time-sensitive analyses. |
| **Missingness** | Missing values lack explanation (e.g. non-response, asymptomatic status, ...) | Reduces interpretability; introduces bias if missingness is non-random or varies over time. |
| **~~Recall Bias~~** | ~~Individuals more accurately report recent symptom onset than distant events.~~ | ~~Over-representation of short delays; skewed epidemic curves 7 serial interval estimates.~~ |
| **Uncertainty** | Onset dates approximate / poorly remembered. | False precision; uncertainty in models suppressed. |
| **Resolution and Rounding** | Respondents often approximate dates (e.g., “about a week ago”), causing date heaping. | Artificial spikes in symptom onset distribution; affects estimates of delay distributions. |
| **Inconsistent definitions** | Date of onset may refer to different types of symptoms | Unclear interpretation of delays, def. changes cause breakpoints  |

# Analysis plan

* Create "perfect" line list data (using *simulist*)
* Add realism (missingness, uncertain dates, multiple symptoms)
* Analyse impact on estimated delay distributions (symptom onset to admission)
  * Use *primarycensored*
  * Naive resolution vs. correct modeling

# New results

### Activity
![](vignettes/figures/repo_activity.png)

### Simulating linelists
- simulating additional features on top of simulist output
  - asymptomatic status
  - multiple symptom types
- `messy_linelist` class
  - typical reporting issues (missingness, date ranges, ...)
  - typical manipulations (imputation, resolving date ranges, coalescing)

### Imputation
- 40% of cases asymptomatic, 20% of symptomatic cases missing date of symptom onset
- Ad-hoc imputation using date of report vs. missingness through primary event window

![](vignettes/figures/issue_imputation.png)

### Uncertainty / resolution
- Onset reported as 1 week ago, 2 weeks ago, ...
- Resolved to 7 days ago, 14 days ago, ... vs. Model with primary event window
![](vignettes/figures/issue_uncertain_dates.png)

### Inconsistent definitions
- Simulated mild and severe symptoms, mild symptoms may appear before severe
- Onset defined as first symptom vs. onset defined as first severe symptom

# Next steps

1.  Write up Review for Onset of disease
2.  Extend to Symptom definition bias
    i.  Use datasets with detailed symptom information (some available from university hospitals)
    ii. Test for impact
    iii. Recommendations for symptom definition bias, e.g. augment WHO guidelines with more detailed onset of symptoms definition (specific combinations of symptoms)
3.  Extend to other variables (clusters)
    i.  Literature Reviews
    ii. List Biases
    iii. Test for Impact
    iv. Recommendations

# Next steps (continued)

4.  Extend Simulation/Testing framework
    i.  Define and describe a perfect linelist
    ii. Extend generation of perfect linelist with further variables
    iii. Implement more biases (screwing with linelist)
    iv. Provide as a package
5.  Write up guideline/paper
    i.  describe the process
    ii. Summarize the findings from the different variables/biases/use cases
    iii. Tables for matching use cases and variables
    iv. Tables listing biases, impact, recommendation
    v.  A checklist to self-evaluate linelist (for data manager)

# Next steps (continued)

6.  Draft Protocol on how to log date of onset of symptoms
7.  Draft Interview questions/scripts for Data Collectors
